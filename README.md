## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serpient/realtime-chat.git
cd realtime-chat
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Deployment

Application is deployed and can be played with here: [https://clever-aryabhata-d8e12c.netlify.app/](https://clever-aryabhata-d8e12c.netlify.app/).

The project uses github actions to handle running tests with each commit. Netlify handles the automatic deployment to the deployed site.

## Technical Stack

The project utilizes:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Socket.io Client
- SCSS for styling
- TypeScript

## Features

Commune is a group chat application where users can jump in and out of conversations surrounding a topic.

- A user can join the chat room only after a display name is set
- A user can enter one of the existing chat rooms and start chatting. Messages are on a per-room basis.
- Chats between connected users will only persist while they are on the page. No persistence has been implemented yet.
- If another user is also connected, their current room presence will be shown in the chat-room navigation panel
- Errors returned from the websocket API will be rendered in an error banner
- Mobile responsiveness

## Future refactor

- There are a lot of duplication of types and the client-socket class between the frontend and backend. I would use a library like `nx` that allow me to organize the 2 projects in one repo, and extract the common types and socket clients into a separate module that can be easily used by both.
- E2E tests for application flows using a tool like Cypress. I ultimately ran out of time but was reluctantly ok with this tradeoff given that the application feature set is mostly dependent on socket behavior, which has backend e2e tests.
- Handle failed calls to the API/Websocket (network failures)
